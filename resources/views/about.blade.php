            I am Kingelffe, a 26 year old content creator from Canada. I started making content in 2020 during the
            COVID-19 pandemic as a way of keeping myself from getting bored. I started on Youtube making tutorial
            videos for the Replay Mod, which led to me being discovered by the owner of a server called Enigma SMP.
            Since joining Enigma SMP, I have been part of many different servers and started a Hardcore Minecraft
            series.
            <br><br>
            In 2021 I started streaming on Youtube while playing on Enigma, but quickly switched over to Twitch to
            accommodate a 24 hour charity stream for ExtraLife. Since starting to stream, I have leaned more into
            streaming than Youtube video creation as it fits my busy schedule better. Streaming on Twitch lead to
            the creation of my Viewer SMP, which I try to stream on once a week.
            <br><br>
            I am also a long term participant in the ExtraLife
